# TravelApp-GUI
Travel plans/budget tracker with GUI

Currently fully functional with the basics. Is not stylized yet though.

to run, make sure you have pickle installed.
download TravelApp2.py
then in command line, navigate to file location,
run python TravelApp2.py
It will generate a tkinter window frame and
create a pkl file that will save/read your travel info.

Based off the code of my other travel app which runs with Command Line Interface, This is aimed at being functional with a GUI.
